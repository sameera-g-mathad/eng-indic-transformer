# English Indic Tranformer

This repository contains the code for machine translation transformer in pytocrh for English to Hindi, Kannada and vice versa. This project is
for educational purpose only for me to learn properly about transformers. The intention of this project is to understand the implementation of transformer architecture for machine translation, learn and implement the transformer architecture from scratch in pytorch and get a hands-on experience of the working of various components of transformer architecture like multi-head attention, positional encoding, feed forward neural networks etc. Also, learn how cross attention works in the decoder part of the transformer along with key-value cahcing and quantization techniques to optimize the model for faster inference.
